# AppleAI Update System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. S3 Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: S3 bucket was not properly configured for public access
- **Fix**: Created scripts to verify S3 configuration and generate presigned URLs when needed
- **Files**: `verify_update_system.sh`, `update_pipeline.sh`

### 2. URL Handling Issues
- **Problem**: UpdateManager couldn't handle complex URLs with query parameters (presigned URLs)
- **Fix**: Enhanced URL parsing in UpdateManager.swift to better handle presigned URLs
- **Files**: `AppleAI/Managers/UpdateManager.swift`

### 3. Version Mismatch
- **Problem**: Inconsistent version numbers between Info.plist and appcast.xml
- **Fix**: Created unified pipeline to ensure version consistency
- **Files**: `update_pipeline.sh`

### 4. Download and Verification Issues
- **Problem**: Downloaded updates weren't properly verified before installation
- **Fix**: Added robust verification steps to check file integrity
- **Files**: `AppleAI/Managers/UpdateManager.swift`

### 5. Installation Permission Issues
- **Problem**: App couldn't install updates due to permission issues
- **Fix**: Added fallback installer script with admin privileges
- **Files**: `AppleAI/Managers/UpdateManager.swift`

### 6. Error Handling
- **Problem**: Poor error handling and user feedback
- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling with detailed logs and user-friendly messages
- **Files**: `AppleAI/Managers/UpdateManager.swift`

### 7. Testing Environment
- **Problem**: Difficult to test update flow
- **Fix**: Created scripts to easily downgrade and test the update process
- **Files**: `downgrade_for_testing.sh`, `test_update_flow.sh`

## New Scripts Created

1. **update_pipeline.sh**
   - Handles the entire update pipeline from building to S3 upload
   - Ensures version consistency across all components
   - Provides different modes for building, uploading, and testing

2. **verify_update_system.sh**
   - Checks all components of the update system
   - Verifies S3 configuration, appcast.xml, and local app settings
   - Provides detailed diagnostic information

3. **downgrade_for_testing.sh**
   - Downgrades the installed app to version 1.0
   - Creates a backup of the current installation
   - Sets up the environment for update testing

4. **test_update_flow.sh**
   - Tests the entire update flow from version 1.0 to 1.1.1
   - Verifies each step of the process
   - Provides guidance for manual steps

## Code Improvements
