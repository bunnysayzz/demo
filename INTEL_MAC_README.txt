# Apple AI - Intel Mac Compatibility Guide

## Running Apple AI on Intel Macs

Apple AI is an arm64 app built primarily for Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, etc.).
However, it will run perfectly on Intel Macs with Rosetta 2 installed.

### Installing Rosetta 2

To install Rosetta 2 (required only once):

1. Open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)
2. Run this command: softwareupdate --install-rosetta
3. Follow the prompts to complete installation

After installing Rosetta 2, Apple AI should run normally on your Intel Mac.
There is no performance penalty for most usage, as the app primarily uses web views.
